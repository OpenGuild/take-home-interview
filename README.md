# Omni Take Home Interview

### Goal

Given an NFT collection on Rinkeby, write a user-facing application that shows the collection's most up-to-date active listings on OpenSea.

### Instructions
1. Please fork this repository into your Github as a private repository and invite me (davidlee1435)
2. Commit your changes to your fork

### More information

For simplicity, assume that we only want to see listings on items where the seller has set the price (as opposed to listings on items where the seller takes the price, i.e. an auction). The information per-listing you want to show to the user is up to you, but at the bare minimum, the UI should show the price and the name of the NFT.

You are free to use any languages/technologies/frameworks that you would like to achieve this task. We recommend that you use the [OpenSea Testnet API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/rinkeby-api-overview) (especially the [Stream API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/stream-api-overview)) or other services that depend on the OpenSea API. Note- an API key is not required when interacting with OpenSea's Testnet API.

To test using OpenSea's Testnet API, you may require some ETH and NFTs. We recommend using the [Paradigm Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to obtain both. If you don't have an eligible Twitter account, please email us with your public key address and we can send you ETH and NFTs to test.

The due date for this project is 1 week from when you were invited to the repo, but it should not take more than 8 hours of your time. After the due date, we will review the code and schedule a 30 minute chat to walk through your design decisions, tradeoffs, and how you would scale this.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
